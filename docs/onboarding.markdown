# Team Communication

* [#flintstone](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/flintstone/)

# BOSH

* Bring up the VPN
* Point BOSH cli at the director:

    ```
    bosh target https://10.155.248.165:25555
    ```

* If the IP address doesn't match, check the [device list](https://control.softlayer.com/devices)

* To access the SL bosh-lite director from your working station:

    ```
    ssh -L 25555:192.168.50.4:25555 root@10.155.248.181
    # And in another terminal:
    bosh target https://localhost:25555
    ```

# Concourse

Our pipeline is public at [flintstone.ci.cf-app.com](https://flintstone.ci.cf-app.com).

```
# name the target 'flintstone' and login with password from the Lastpass CLI.
fly --target flintstone login --concourse-url http://10.155.248.166:8080 --user admin --password $(lpass show concourse --password)

# if the auth expired, re-login using the previously named target
fly -t flintstone login

# create or update a pipeline from yaml file
fly -t flintstone set-pipeline -p test-exists -c test-exists.yml

# destroy a pipeline
fly -t flintstone destroy-pipeline -p test-exists

# hijack into a job
fly intercept -t flintstone --job bits-service/run-tests

# let fly offer which container to hijack. Also, use sh instead of bash for busybox-based containers.
fly intercept -t flintstone sh

# run a single task with local changes without having to commit to git before
fly execute -t flintstone --config ci/tasks/run-tests.yml --input=git-bits-service=.

# same, but with two inputs
fly execute -t flintstone --config ci/tasks/upload-to-object-storage.yml --input=git-bits-service-release=. --input=releases=dev_releases/bits-service
```

# Install git hooks

We use this hook to prevent accidential commits of secrets:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
~/workspace/bits-service/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

This needs to be done for each repo where the hook should run, e.g. with

```bash
for d in ~/workspace/bits-service*; do
  (
    cd "$d"
    ~/workspace/bits-service/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
  )
done
```
