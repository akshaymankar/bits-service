# Introduction

The bits-service is an extraction from existing functionality of the [cloud controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng). It encapsulates all "bits operations" into its own, separately scalable service. All bits operations comprise buildpacks, droplets, app_stashes, packages and the buildpack_cache.

### Supported Backends
Bits currently supports [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) and the following [Fog](http://fog.io/) connectors:

* AWS S3
* Azure
* Google
* Local (NFS)
* Openstack

# Packages

A package are the files that make up an application from the developer's point of view (source code).

## Uploading a Package

> Example request:

```shell
curl -X PUT 'https://internal.example.com/packages/c33e184b-e698-4290-952e-4047601e4627?async=true' \
  -F package=@package-file -F resources='[{
  "sha1": "8b381f8864b572841a26266791c64ae97738a659",
  "fn":   "script.rb",
  "mode": "0644"
}]'
```

> Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{
  "guid":       "c33e184b-e698-4290-952e-4047601e4627",
  "state":      "PROCESSING_UPLOAD",
  "type":       "bits",
  "created_at": "2018-08-07T12:05:31.075337155+02:00",
  "sha1":       "54f4f25322f2a30d1ba50e556ff8249d0bba9bf4",
  "sha256":     "2a953858fee9aa617aa8617b5b805e82c3f859be02e9a5ae175f8a55e0d2e020",
}
```

### HTTP Request
`PUT /packages/:guid`

where `:guid` is the package's GUID.

### Query Parameters
Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
`async`   | `false` | When `true`, request will return immediately, and upload the package to the backend blobstore in the background. The package state will be updated in the Cloud Controller once the background upload is finished.

### Request Body

The request body must either be a multipart upload with the following form fields

`package: <formfile>` or `bits: <formfile>`

Optional:`resources: [ { "sha1": "<sha1-checksum>", "fn": "<filename>", "mode": "<filemode>" }, ...]`

Where `package` and `bits` can be used interchangeably.

Or, if the body is not a multipart upload, but contains a `:source_guid`, its value is treated as `:guid` and an attempt is made to copy the package from the one identified by the value of `:source_guid`.

### Access
Internal endpoint only

## Downloading a Package

A droplet is the result of staging an application package. It contains the bits produced by the buildpack, typically application code and dependencies.

## Uploading a Droplet

> Example request:

```shell
curl -X PUT 'https://internal.example.com/droplets/c33e184b-e698-4290-952e-4047601e4627/b1d2a97c5033319632e65beba49dd92da18c1d20' \
  -F droplet=@droplet-file
```

> Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

### HTTP Request
`PUT /droplets/:guid/:checksum`

where `:guid` is the droplet's GUID and `:checksum` is its checksum.

### Request Body
`droplet: <formfile>`

If the body is not a file upload, but contains a `:source_guid`, its value is treated as `:guid` and an attempt is made to copy the droplet from the one identified by the value of `:source_guid`.

### Access
Internal endpoint only

## Uploading a Droplet with Digest in Header

> Example request:

```shell

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

### HTTP Request
`PUT /droplets/:guid`

where `:guid` is the droplet's GUID.

### Request Headers

`Digest: sha256=abcdefg`

The format of the `Digest` header's value is `<Algorithm>=<Value>`. Currently only `sha256` is supported.

### Request Body

# App Stash

App Stash optimizes the repeated app push, so that unchanged files need not to be uploaded more than once. It acts like a cache to which files can be uploaded and later referred to in order to bundle those files into a package.

## Matching Entries

> Example request:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://internal.example.com/app_stash/matches' \
    -d '[{
          "sha1": "8b381f8864b572841a26266791c64ae97738a659",
          "size": 534567
        },
        {
          "sha1": "594eb15515c89bbfb0874aa4fd4128bee0a1d0b5",
          "size": 9874
        }]'
```

> Given that the following files are present in app stash:

```shell
Size | Filename / Checksum
-----|-----------------------------------------
9874 | 594eb15515c89bbfb0874aa4fd4128bee0a1d0b5
6787 | 987348957349857349349haf6876786ehg909034
1029 | abddd9587agbacfbab98d9890908a8979bbb7898
```

> Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

[{
  "sha1": "594eb15515c89bbfb0874aa4fd4128bee0a1d0b5",
  "size": 9874
}]
```

This endpoint matches a list of file entries with entries already in the blobstore app stash and returns the ones that are already there.

### HTTP Request
`POST /app_stash/matches`

### Body Parameters
JSON array with elements as in `{"sha1": "<sha1-checksum>", "size": <file-size>}`.

### Access
Internal endpoint only

**Deprecated.** _This endpoint will be removed in future major versions of the Bits-Service. This functionality is now integrated in [Uploading a Package](#uploading-a-package)._

> Example request:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://internal.example.com/app_stash/entries' \
  -F application=@entries
```

> Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

[{
  "sha1": "8b381f8864b572841a26266791c64ae97738a659",
  "fn":   "script.rb",
  "mode": "0644"
}]
```

     -d '[{
           "sha1": "8b381f8864b572841a26266791c64ae97738a659",
           "fn":   "script.rb",
           "mode": "755"
         },
         {

# Signed URLs

In order to prevent leakage of resources, all external access to the Bits-Service must be done using signed URLs. Signing usually requires username and password.

## Signing a URL

> Example request:

```shell
curl 'https://username:password@internal.example.com/sign/packages/bdf47b84-1349-4abd-9561-5004858dfa05?verb=put'
```

> Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

https://bits-service.example.com/signed/packages/test-package?signature=313534313136363839352f7061636b616765732f6d79677569642067656865696de41965ab39e6fc7c04b662edc553cbb39fa62b2c5f4265dd38b241bee95eff40&expires=1497357804
```

### HTTP Request
`GET /sign/:path`

where `:path` is the URL path of the signed entity.


### Query Parameters
Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
`verb`    | `GET`   | Defines the verb that can be used in association with the signed URL. Either `GET`, `PUT`, or `POST`.

### Access
Internal endpoint only

> Example signed upload:

```shell
curl -X PUT 'https://internal.example.com/signed/packages/bdf47b84-1349-4abd-9561-5004858dfa05?signature=313534313136363839352f7061636b616765732f6d79677569642067656865696de41965ab39e6fc7c04b662edc553cbb39fa62b2c5f4265dd38b241bee95eff40&expires=1541166895' \
  -F package=@package-file
```

<aside class="notice">Notice:
 <ul>
  <li>Signing URL does not imply that the resource exists.</li>
  <li>Resource endpoint `app_stash/matches` only supports `POST` as `verb` query parameter</li>
 </ul>
</aside>

# Metrics

The bits-service emits the following metrics:

## Response times

### Status code agnostic

These are of the form `bits.<request-method>-<resource-type>-time`, e.g.:

* `bits.PUT-packages-time`
* `bits.DELETE-droplets-time`
* `bits.POST-app_stash-time`

### By status code

These are of the form `bits.<request-method>-<resource-type>-<status-code>-time`, e.g.:

* `bits.PUT-packages-403-time`
* `bits.DELETE-droplets-200-time`
* `bits.POST-app_stash-500-time`

## Response sizes

Similar to response times, these are of the form `bits.<request-method>-<resource-type>-size`, e.g.:

* `bits.GET-buildpacks-size`
* `bits.DELETE-droplets-size`
* `bits.POST-app_stash-size`

While they are available for all requests, these are most interesting for `GET` requests.
## Request sizes

Similar to response times, these are of the form `bits.<request-method>-<resource-type>-request-size`, e.g.:

* `bits.GET-buildpacks-request-size`
* `bits.DELETE-droplets-request-size`
* `bits.POST-app_stash-request-size`

While they are available for all requests, these are most interesting for `PUT`/`POST` requests.

## Request status codes

These are of the form `bits.status-<status-code>`, e.g.:

* `bits.status-404`
* `bits.status-200`

## Copying bits to the blobstore

* `bits.app_stash-cp_r_to_blobstore-time`
* `bits.packages-cp_to_blobstore-time`
* `bits.buildpack-cp_to_blobstore-time`
* `bits.droplet-cp_to_blobstore-time`
* `bits.buildpack_cache-cp_to_blobstore-time`
